# I analyse a fictional game and look at user installs, revenue, country of installs etc. and produce dashboards that help see patterns in our data.

The complete Tableau dashboards can be seen in `mukherjee_phoenix_games.twb`. There is a powerpoint presentation showing those same dashboards (minus the interactivity of Tableau) are visible on `mukherjee_phoenix_games_ppt0.pptx`.

There is also `battle_short_analysis.ipynb` where I provide additional conlusions and insights.
